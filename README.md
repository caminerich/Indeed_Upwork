Sampling of work from iWorkGlobal contract with Indeed.com

I worked with international marketing teams to develop Jupyter Notebooks (called Ishbooks) to query a NoSql database and produce a JSON output compatible with HTML email template. The NoSql database is called Imhotep and the language is IQL (Imhotep Query language). Ishbook stands for Imhotep Shell Language Book, which is essentially a Jupyter Notebook. I worked in Jira and Slack. I turned around Jira tickets within 2 weeks or less.
